        <p>Homemade pizza! Name something better? No? Yeah, you can't! Homemade pizza is dramatically
            better than frozen store bought pizza. It's also, depending on your local pizza community,
            better than your town pizza. It's not too hard, but requires some preparation.

            <li>Sugar-      1/2 to 1 tsp</li>
            <h3>Toppings:</h3>
            <p class="pizza">This part is your choice, I will put down what we use.</p>
            <li>Fresh skim mozzarella cheese-       1/2 lb.</li>
            <li>Fresh basil-        1 small handful, chopped.</li>
            <li>Fresh mushrooms-        8oz, sliced thin.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Combine half of your flour, yeast, sugar, and salt for your dough in a large mixing bowl.
            We use a KitchenAid with a dough hook on a low setting. If you do not have a mixer
            you can use a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and water.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the rest of the flour while you combine the ingredients. Your goal is to have
            the dough be a cohesive ball, that you can pull away from the sides of the bowl. It should
            still be sticky, but not stick to your hands leaving dough residue.</li>
        <li>Cover the sides of a clean, large bowl with olive oil. Enough to coat the sides but not drench the bowl.</li>
        <li>Form your dough into a round ball. Transfer to your bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
            Leave on the counter for 30 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, prepare your sauce.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, pulse your tomatoes until pureed.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine your oil and butter over medium heat until the butter is melted.</li>
        <li>Add oregano, garlic, salt and pepper flakes. Stir frequently until the flavors
            have enough time to 'get to know each other.'</li>
        <li>Add your tomatoes, sugar, and diced onions.</li>
        <li>Bring your sauce to a simmer and reduce your heat to low. Cover saucepan. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 500 degrees F. With a pizza stone place on the middle rack in the cold oven.
            If you do not have a pizza stone, you will need to use a cooking tray to cook your pizza on.
            However, do not place the tray in the oven until you are ready to cook the pizza.
            Placing a pizza stone in the cold oven allows the stone to come up to temp with the oven for a crispy bottom.
        </li>
        <li>Place mozzarella in the freezer to firm.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, transfer the dough ball to a floured surface and knead until smooth.</li>
        <li>Work into a 10" to 12" circle.</li>
        <li>Shred your firm mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Lightly dust cornstarch on a pizza paddle and transfer your dough onto the paddle.</li>
        <li>Add your sauce, using a spoon to gently and evenly cover the base of your pizza dough.</li>
        <li>Cover entire pizza in shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Add favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Place pizza in the oven on the pizza stone or on a cooking tray. The cornstarch on
            the paddle should allow the pizza to slide off the paddle and onto the pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Cook 13-15 minutes or until the top is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice and enjoy!</li>
